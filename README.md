# Nashville Houses Data Cleaning with SQL Server

SQL data cleaning project using the Nashville housing dataset.

In this project I drive a cleaning data process to prepare data for analysis by modifying incomplete data, splitting addresses, and modifying improperly formatted data. This dataset contains over 50,000 records about the housing market in Nashville. It includes owner info, addresses, property value, dates sold, and much more, so they have many missing addresses, duplicate records, and dates with bad format. The dataset is available on Kaggle.

My goal was to import the data to SQL Server in Azure Data Studio and clean it so that it is more useable and looks better.


I used SQL Server in Azure Data Studio to execute queries that populated missing data, split data into new columns, removed unnecessary columns and some data exploration to find useful insigths.

This is a Case study with focus on data cleaning using SQL queries. The dataset is available on Kaggle.
