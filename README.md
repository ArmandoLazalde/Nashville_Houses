# Nashville Houses Data Cleaning with SQL Server

SQL data cleaning project using the Nashville housing dataset.

In this project I realized a cleaning process to prepare data for analysis. The dataset contains over 50,000 records about the housing market in Nashville, it includes owner info, addresses, property value, dates sold, and much more, so it have many missing addresses, duplicate records, and dates with bad format.
I used SQL Server in Azure Data Studio to execute queries that populated missing data, split data into new columns, removed unnecessary columns and some data exploration to find useful insigths. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data)
