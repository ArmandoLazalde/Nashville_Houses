# Nashville Houses Data Cleaning with SQL Server

SQL data cleaning project using the Nashville housing dataset.

In the Nashville Housing Sales Data Cleaning project, I cleaned a public database on Nashville house sales. I used SQL Server in Azure Data Studio to execute queries that populated missing data, split data into new columns, removed unnecessary columns and some data exploration to find useful insigths.
